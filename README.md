# Cross-Encoder-Reranker-Signals-for-Robust-RAG-Defense-Against-Poisoning-Attacks
Cross-Encoder Reranker Signals for Robust RAG Defense Against Poisoning Attacks introduces CEG-RAG, a practical defense framework for corpus poisoning in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG systems improve factuality by grounding LLM outputs in retrieved evidence, but they also expand the attack surface: adversaries can inject crafted passages into the knowledge base so that poisoned chunks are retrieved, ranked highly, and ultimately steer generation toward attacker-chosen targets.

CEG-RAG leverages a security signal that already exists in many strong RAG pipelines: the internal representations of a cross-encoder reranker. Instead of treating the reranker as a black box that outputs relevance scores, we extract the reranker’s final-layer pooled [CLS] embeddings for query–passage pairs and use them as features for a multiple-instance learning (MIL) detector. The retrieved set is modeled as a “bag” (context) and each passage as an “instance” (chunk), enabling weak supervision with context-level labels only. The model jointly supports (i) context-level poisoning detection and (ii) chunk-level localization of suspicious passages.

When poisoning is detected, CEG-RAG performs context repair before generation: it filters high-risk chunks using learned poison scores and replaces them with lower-ranked candidates while maintaining a fixed context budget. This design keeps overhead low—no extra LLM calls are required—and prevents malicious evidence from reaching the generator.

We evaluate CEG-RAG on MS-MARCO, Natural Questions (NQ), and HotpotQA under the strong PoisonedRAG attack. Results show consistently strong detection and localization (high TPR at low FPR) and substantial mitigation effectiveness, reducing attack success rate (ASR) while recovering correct answers. We further demonstrate robustness across rerankers (BGE, mGTE, and MS-MARCO MiniLM) and compare against recent defenses including GMTP, RobustRAG, TrustRAG, and RAGuard, where CEG-RAG delivers the most consistent ASR reduction across datasets.
